# Shopee Code League 2021

## Data Science Category - Address Elements Extraction

In this competition, I worked on addresses collected by Shopee to build a model to correctly extract
Point of Interest (POI) Names and Street Names from unformatted Indonesian addresses.

I developed and trained a bidirectional LSTM-CRF Neural Network Model for this Named Entity Recognition task.
